In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
Dataset The dataset used for this task is World_Bank's_total_population_dataset.
Tools used: Microsoft Excel
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:
Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.
Visualization: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.
Conclusion In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.
Thank you for reviewing my submission!
